    It's you
    It's always you
    If I'm ever gonna fall in love
    I know it's gon' be you

    It's you
    It's always you
    Met a lot of people
    But nobody feels like you

    So please don't break my heart
    Don't tear me apart
    I know how it starts
    Trust me I've been broken before

    Don't break me again
    I am delicate
    Please don't break my heart
    Trust me I've been broken before

    I've been broken, yeah
    I know how it feels
    To be open
    And then find out your love isn't real

    I'm still hurting, yeah
    I'm hurting inside
    I'm so scared to fall in love
    But if it's you then I'll try

    It's you
    It's always you
    If I'm ever gonna fall in love
    I know it's gon' be you

    It's you
    It's always you
    Met a lot of people
    But nobody feels like you

    So please, don't break my heart
    Don't tear me apart
    I know how it starts
    Trust me I've been broken before

    Don't break me again
    I am delicate
    Please, don't break my heart
    Trust me I've been broken before

    No, I'm not the best at choosing lovers
    We both know my past speaks for itself
    If you don't think that we're right for each other
    Then please don't let history repeat itself

    'Cause I want you
    I want you
    There's nothing else I want

    'Cause I want you
    I want you
    And you're the only thing I want

    It's you
    It's always you
    If I'm ever gonna fall in love
    I know it's gon' be you

    It's you
    It's always you
    Met a lot of people
    But nobody feels like you

    So please, don't break my heart
    Don't tear me apart
    I know how it starts
    Trust me I've been broken before

    Don't break me again
    I am delicate
    Please don't break my heart
    Trust me I've been broken before
